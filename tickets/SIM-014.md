# SIM-014: Premium “Accessible Ethereal” Vibe Pass (Holographic System + Micro-Delight)

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Make Simplifit feel **premium and breathtakingly elegant**—like a design + motion team polished it for months—while staying **simple, readable, and not over-the-top**. Animations must be smooth, purposeful, and grounded in the product loop (Teach/Practice/Weigh/Adjust).

## 👤 USER STORY
**As a** user trying to build habits,  
**I want** the UI to feel calm, tactile, and rewarding,  
**So that** I trust the process and enjoy coming back—without feeling sold to.

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### A) Motion System Feels Cohesive
- A single, consistent motion language:
  - Standardized durations (e.g., 180–240ms for micro, 300–450ms for transitions)
  - Consistent easing (springs where tactile, timing where informational)
- No “random” animations: every motion reinforces feedback, hierarchy, or progress.

### B) Performance + Stability
- Runs at **stable 60fps** in common flows on mid-tier devices.
- No Reanimated worklet warnings / redbox errors.
- No heavy overdraw or layered blurs that tank performance.

### C) Accessibility & Grandma Test
- Large tap targets remain large.
- Readability improves (type scale, contrast).
- Supports Reduce Motion:
  - If enabled, replaces large movement with fades/opacity + subtle scale only.

### D) “Micro-Delight” Without Clown Energy
- Add one signature “Simplifit charm” moment:
  - Example: a tiny **stick-figure weightlifter** micro-animation after meaningful completions (not every tap).
  - Must be subtle, quick, and skippable; appears occasionally or only on milestones.

---

## ❌ NON-GOALS
- No new major features (Weekly Review, new screens) unless needed to showcase the vibe pass.
- No heavy animation libraries unless absolutely necessary (prefer existing `react-native-reanimated` + `react-native-svg`).

## 🧭 SCOPE: WHERE TO POLISH
Prioritize the “daily loop surfaces”:
- Home: `components/home/DailyPulseFeed.tsx`, `components/ui/AmbientBackground.tsx`, `components/ui/HolographicCard.tsx`
- Plate Check: `components/modals/PlateCheckModal.tsx`
- Any shimmer/reward animations tied to protein presence or completion
- Loading/empty states: `components/home/HomeSkeleton.tsx`

---

## 🛠 DELIVERABLES (Concrete)

### Part 1: Design Tokens + Visual Consistency
- Create/standardize a **single token source** for:
  - Colors (stone palette + 1–2 accent gradients)
  - Type scale (headlines vs body vs labels)
  - Spacing + radii + shadows
- Audit and unify:
  - Card elevation/shadow
  - Border radii
  - Background noise/gradient usage
  - Typography weights and line heights

### Part 2: Motion Guidelines (Document + Implement)
- Define a motion spec (brief doc or section in `docs/technical.md`):
  - Default transition presets (enter/exit, press, success)
  - Haptic pairing rules (when to use light vs success)
- Implement consistent transitions:
  - Card press: subtle scale spring (0.985–0.995), quick return
  - Modal open/close: one signature slide + fade that feels “liquid”
  - Success states: shimmer + gentle glow, never confetti spam

### Part 3: Holographic System Upgrade (Premium, Not Loud)
- Improve “holographic” feel with:
  - Subtle animated gradient drift
  - Controlled specular highlight sweep on completion
  - Minimal noise texture (avoid banding)
- Keep it restrained: the UI should feel calm even when it’s “alive.”

### Part 4: Micro-Delight “Signature Moment”
- Implement a tiny animated character/illustration that appears:
  - On meaningful wins (e.g., first protein hit of the day, streak milestones, lesson completion)
  - Not constantly (avoid habituation/annoyance)
- Recommended approach:
  - Use `react-native-svg` for a simple stick figure and animate with Reanimated (scale/translate/opacity).
  - Respect Reduce Motion and disable the character animation if enabled.

### Part 5: QA Polish Pass
- Remove visual jitter, misaligned paddings, awkward timing, inconsistent haptics.
- Ensure transitions don’t compete with readability (text remains stable during reading).

## 🔍 TESTING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Home scroll feels smooth and stable (no frame drops)
- [ ] PlateCheck open/close feels premium and predictable
- [ ] Success feedback reads clearly in <2 seconds
- [ ] Reduce Motion enabled: animations simplify correctly
- [ ] Haptics feel intentional (not spammy)
- [ ] No “overdesigned” clutter; UI still passes Grandma Test

## ⏱️ ESTIMATED EFFORT
~1–2 weeks depending on polish depth and iteration cycles (this is an art-direction level task).
