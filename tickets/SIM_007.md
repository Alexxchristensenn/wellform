# SIM-007: Voice Integration (Wiring the Content Bank)

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Connect the newly created `services/contentBank.ts` to the UI components. The app must now "speak" using the "Norm Macdonald" persona we have generated.

## 👤 USER STORY
**As a** User,
**I want** to see a witty, specific reaction when I log my food,
**So that** I feel acknowledged by the app's personality.

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1.  **Plate Check "Reaction" View:**
    * **Current State:** Modal closes immediately on save.
    * **New State:**
        * On "Log It," the modal stays open.
        * Transition to a "Feedback View" (Fade in).
        * Display a witty line from `getPlateReact(hasProtein, hasPlants)`.
        * **Animation:** A subtle success icon (Checkmark or Sparkles) + the text.
        * **Auto-Close:** The modal dismisses itself after 2.5 - 3 seconds (enough time to read).
2.  **Home Screen Content:**
    * **Lesson Card:** Replace hardcoded text with `getDailyGoldenRule()`.
    * **Subtitle:** Display the specific topic (e.g., "The Whoosh Effect") so users know what they are learning.
3.  **Loading States:**
    * Update `HomeSkeleton` or any global loading spinners to use `getLoadingLine()` instead of just "Loading...".

## 🛠 TECHNICAL TASKS
1.  **Edit `components/modals/PlateCheckModal.tsx`:**
    * Add local state: `feedback: PlateReact | null`.
    * Logic:
      ```typescript
      const handleSave = async () => {
        await logPlateCheck(...);
        const reaction = getPlateReact(protein, plants);
        setFeedback(reaction);
        setTimeout(() => onClose(), 3000); // Auto-close
      };
      ```
2.  **Edit `components/home/DailyPulseFeed.tsx`:**
    * Import `getDailyGoldenRule`.
    * Pass the dynamic rule into `LessonCard`.

## 🛡️ DESIGN GUIDELINES
* **Typography:** The "Reaction" text should be large, centered, and distinct.
* **Tone:** Let the text do the heavy lifting. Don't clutter it with too many confetti animations. The dry wit is the reward.
