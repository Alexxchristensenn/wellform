SIM-018: Identity Cycle & Profile Scaffold
🎯 OBJECTIVE

Implement Context-Aware Session Management. The app currently suffers from "Sticky Sessions," where new users (or the same user restarting the onboarding flow) inherit old data because the anonymous session persists indefinitely.

We need to enforce a Hard Session Reset when entering the Onboarding flow and provide a Profile/Debug Interface to verify identity changes.
👤 USER STORY

As a User, I want to be able to start over or sign out completely, So that I don't see old data when I'm trying to start a fresh journey.

As a Developer/QA, I want to see the current User ID (UID) on a screen, So that I can verify that the backend is actually creating new sessions when I expect it to.
🔨 TASK REQUIREMENTS
1. The "Scorched Earth" Onboarding Policy

    Context: The /onboarding route represents the start of a new user journey.

    Requirement: When this screen mounts, the app must check for an existing session and destroy it.

    Outcome:

        If a user navigates to Onboarding, they are immediately signed out.

        Any local cache (React Query/Context) associated with the previous user must be invalidated.

        This ensures the subsequent signInAnonymously() call (later in the flow) generates a fresh UID.

2. The Profile / Debug Scaffold

    Context: We currently lack a way to view the current user's status or manually sign out.

    Requirement: Create a basic (tabs)/profile screen using the standard design language (StyleSheet, High Contrast).

    Features:

        Identity Display: specific text showing the current Firebase UID (or "Not Signed In").

        Sign Out Action: A button that triggers auth().signOut() and redirects to Onboarding.

        Environment Check: Display a small indicator (text) confirming we are in "Alpha / Debug" mode.

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

    Automatic Purge: Launching the app and navigating to /onboarding (even if previously logged in) results in a null auth state initially.

    Visual Verification:

        User A completes onboarding -> Profile shows UID: XYZ....

        User A hits "Sign Out" -> Returns to Onboarding.

        User completes onboarding again -> Profile shows UID: ABC... (Must be different).

    Data Isolation: The Home Feed must be empty after a reset/re-onboarding sequence (confirming the old data isn't leaking into the new session).

🛡️ TECHNICAL GUARDRAILS

    Routing Safety: Ensure the "Sign Out" action in the Profile screen correctly redirects the user (likely to /onboarding) to prevent a blank screen state.

    Design Consistency: Use the established "Accessible Ethereal" styling (Black background, White text) for the Profile screen. Do not use NativeWind.

    Offline Awareness: The Sign Out function should work even if the device is offline (clearing the local session state).
